## Overview
In this project, we work with a few number of agents to simulate crowd behaviour in the different scenarios such as train station waiting area. We discover how patterns of movement can be formed from the simpliest of rules that mimic crowd behaviour in the real world. By the end, we have created a crowded scene with humanoid characters walking and avoiding each other as well as reaching to their goals step by step.

## Simulation


## Scripts
The Scripts section delves into the codes that powers the simulation. It includes explanations of the scripts responsible for simulating passenger behavior, managing events within the virtual train station waiting area.

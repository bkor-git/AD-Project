# ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
This repository is still being updated. Features and code may change.

# Overview
This repository supplements our paper "Towards Real-Time Detection of Anomalous Behavior in Crowds from Accelerometer Time Series," accepted in EUSIPCO 2025. It provides synthetic datasets for anomaly detection (AD) and change point detection (CPD) in **multi-entity, multivariate time series data**, enabling reproducibility and further research on crowd anomaly detection.

## Dataset
This folder contains the datasets used for evaluating the methods. You can either generate datasets using the provided codes and executable files, 
or  

- **Request Full Dataset Access**  
  The full dataset is too large to host on GitHub.
  To request access, email [bahar.kor@tufts.edu] with the subject: "Dataset-Name Full Dataset Access Request" 

  - **chenchaoticsystem** â€“ Synthetic dataset generated using Coupled Chen Chaotic Systems.  
  - **simulation** â€“ Synthetic datasets generated from Unity Environment. 

## Model
This folder contains the implementations of the different models:  
- **MTS-AD-Models** â€“ Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection models. These are adapted implementations from the original GitHub repository: [TranAD-Repository](https://github.com/imperial-qore/TranAD.git)
  
- **SAE** â€“ Simple AutoEncoder (SAE) implementation

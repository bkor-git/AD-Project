# ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
This repository is still being updated. Features and code may change.  

>  **Note:** Finalized features and code will be available by the end of October, following the publication of our accepted conference paper at the 33rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2025). Stay tuned for updates!

# Overview
This repository supplements our paper "Towards Real-Time Detection of Anomalous Behavior in Crowds from Accelerometer Time Series," accepted in EUSIPCO 2025. It provides synthetic datasets for anomaly detection (AD) and change point detection (CPD) in **multi-entity, multivariate time series data**, enabling reproducibility and further research on crowd anomaly detection.

## Dataset
This folder contains the datasets used for evaluating the methods. You can either generate datasets using the provided codes and executable files, 
or  

- **Request Full Dataset Access**  
  The full dataset is too large to host on GitHub.
  To request access, email [bahar.kor@tufts.edu] with the subject: "Dataset-Name Full Dataset Access Request" 

  - **chenchaoticsystem** â€“ Synthetic dataset generated using Coupled Chen Chaotic Systems.  
  - **simulation** â€“ Synthetic datasets generated from Unity Environment. 

## Model
This folder contains the implementations of the different models:  
- **MTS-AD-Models** â€“ Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection models. These are adapted implementations from the original GitHub repository: [TranAD-Repository](https://github.com/imperial-qore/TranAD.git)
  
- **SAE** â€“ Simple AutoEncoder (SAE) implementation

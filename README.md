# ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
This repository is still being updated. Features and code may change.

# Overview
This repository supplements our paper "Towards Real-Time Detection of Anomalous Behavior in Crowds from Accelerometer Time Series," accepted in EUSIPCO 2025. It provides synthetic datasets for anomaly detection in **multi-entity multivariate time series data**, enabling reproducibility and further research on crowd anomaly detection.

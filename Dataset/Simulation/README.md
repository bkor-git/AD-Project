## Overview
In this project, we work with a number of agents to simulate crowd behaviour in different scenarios, such as a train station waiting area. We discover how patterns of movement can be formed from the simplest of rules that mimic crowd behaviour in the real world. By the end, we have created a crowded scene with humanoid characters walking and avoiding each other as well as reaching their goals one step at a time.

## Simulation


## Scripts
The Scripts section delves into the codes that power the simulation. It includes explanations of the scripts responsible for simulating passenger behavior and managing events within the virtual train station waiting area.
* **DropCylinder**:  
*	**ExportCsv**: 
*	**Passenger**:  
*	**PoissonArrival**: The code for controlling the arrival time of the agents in the scene.
*	**Wander**: Script to control the green agents that are wandering around in the scene. 

### Build Files
The Build Files section provides practical information for users who want to experience the simulation firsthand. It includes instructions on how to run the executable files that bring your simulation to life and export the agent information as CSV files.

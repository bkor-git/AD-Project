# Coupled Chen Chaotic Oscillators Dataset Generation

Here, we provide the code to **simulate and generate datasets** from multiple coupled Chen chaotic oscillators with environmental coupling. The generated datasets can be used for research, analysis, or machine learning tasks involving anomaly detection or change point detection in Multi-Entity Multivariate time series.

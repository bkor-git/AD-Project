### Synthetic Dataset Samples

This folder contains **sample synthetic multi-entity multivariate time-series datasets** that were generated using coupled Chen chaotic systems.  

Due to space limitation, we only include a few representative examples here. You can either generate the dataset using the provided codes and example usage, or request access to the full dataset by emailing [bahar.kor@tufts.edu] with the subject: **ChenChaoticSystem Full Dataset Access Request**

Included sample datasets:

- `normal.zip` – Example of normal behavior data (Train set).  
- `abnormal.zip` – Example of abnormal behavior data (Test set).  
- `normalTest.zip` – A test set representing normal conditions (Test set).
